#' Intersect a shapefile with kml files and return the kml files as a shapefile, as well as the files
#' that were intersected
#' 
#' This function reads in a list of kml files, converts them into simplified spatial polygons, reads
#' in a shapefile of location data (points or polygons), and then finds out what kml files these 
#' location data reside in.
#' 
#' This is super useful because NEON data flight lines and tiles only come as KML files and sometimes
#' we do not want to process the entire batch of data - we only need a tile or two of data based on
#' where our field data is located.
#' 
#' This function lets us use that field data and find only the tiles we need to process, thus 
#' cutting down on our processing time immensely.
#' 
#' This function will simplify complex kml files - it will turn them into polygons based on the 
#' greatest extent in each direction. This should be used for intersection purposes only.
